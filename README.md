## 🧩 Overview

The **GEANT4-HGCAL** simulation framework includes:

- Detailed **CMS HGCAL geometry** implementation (silicon and scintillator layers)
- Configurable **detector segmentation** and **material definitions**
- Simulation of **energy deposition**, **particle propagation**, and **secondary production**
- Built-in **ROOT** integration for analysis and visualisation
- Modular structure for extension to other detector architectures
